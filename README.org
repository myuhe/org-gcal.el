  =org-gcal= is now available in the famous emacs package repo [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]],
  so the recommended way is to install it through Emacs package
  management system.

* Installation

1. Go to [[https://console.developers.google.com/project][Google Developers Console]]

2. Create a project (with any name)

3. Click on the project

4. Click on *APIs & Services* then *Credentials*

5. Click on *Create Credentials* and *Oauth client ID* with
   Application type /Installed application/, Installed application
   type /Other/

6. Click on *Create Client ID*

7. Record the Client ID and Client secret for setup.

8. Under the same *APIs & Services* menu section, select *Library*

9. Scroll down to *Calendar API*. Click the *Enable* button to enable
   calendar API access to the app you created in steps 5 & 6.

   Go to [[https://www.google.com/calendar/render][Google setting page]] to check the calendar ID.

10. Go to [[https://www.google.com/calendar/render][Google setting page]] and click the gear-shaped settings icon
    in the upper right, then select "Settings" from the drop down
    list.

11. Select the "Setting for my Calendars" tab on the left, which will
    display a list of your calendars.

12. Select the calendar you would like to synchronize with. This will
    take you to the "Calendar Settings" page for that calendar. Near
    the end is a section titled "Integrate Calendar". Following the XML,
    ICAL, and HTML tags, you will see your Calendar ID.

13. Copy the Calendar ID for use in the settings below, where you will
    use it as the first element in the org-gcal-file-alist for
    associating calendars with specific org files. You can associate
    different calendars with different org files, so repeat this for
    each calendar you want to use.

** Setting example

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-gcal)
(setq org-gcal-client-id "your-id-foo.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      org-gcal-client-secret "your-secret"
      org-gcal-file-alist '(("your-mail@gmail.com" .  "~/schedule.org")
                            ("another-mail@gmail.com" .  "~/task.org")))
#+end_src

** Multiple accounts

   There's no support for multiple accounts.  If you want to use
   org-gcal with calendars from different accounts, you can give
   permissions to the account you configured via the calendar's
   settings interface.

   Fetch Google calendar events and populate =org-gcal-file-alist=

   should refresh token on a regular basis.

* Other features
** Minimize alerts

Modify =org-gcal-notify-p= from =t= to =nil=

** Headers in org-gcal files

   Create variable org-gcal-header-alist

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-gcal-header-alist '(("me@gmail.com" . "#+CATEGORY: personal\n")))
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I often need to set headers in org-mode files to control categories, archive locations, and other local variables. This patch allows for the insertion of arbitary headers. It creates a single alist variable (org-gcal-header-alist) and if it exists for a given file it inserts it before writing the calendar items.
#+END_QUOTE

* Error
** I get "Org-gcal error: Couldn't parse your-cal.org"
   The org file where you sync the calendar must have all entries with
   timestamps and a particular format to be parsed correctly. When
   synching for the first time, we recommend is to use a blank file
   and continue from that.
